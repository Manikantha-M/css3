/* object-fit property */
/* The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container.
values: fill, contain, cover, none, scale-down.
cover: the image will fill the height and width of its box, once again maintaining its aspect-ratio but often cropping the image in the process. 
contain: increases or decreases the size of the image to fill the box whilst preserving its aspect-ratio. */
